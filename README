## Resume Data Structure

The `resume_data` dictionary contains the information that will be populated in the resume. Here's an example of how itâ€™s structured:

```python
resume_data = {

    "contact": "Email: jane.doe@example.com | Phone: 987-654-3210",
    "education": [
        ["ABC High School", "2018", "9.8/10"],
        ["DEF Senior School", "2020", "9.6/10"],
        ["XYZ University", "2025", "9.2/10"]
    ],
